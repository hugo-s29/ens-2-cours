  \chapter{Introduction}

  Parallel computing has been developed to solve many computational problems.
  Platforms can represent multicore chips, cluster of servers, grids, clouds (they provide services, virtualized resources), fog (some services are precessed at the "edge" of cloud, smart devices).
  One question we can ask ourselves is: what to optimize?
  A few examples include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item total computation time (most parallelism);
    \item cost of infrastructure;
    \item total number of operations (parallelism overheard);
    \item to be able to solve larger problems;
    \item minimize energy/power (use renewable energy?).
  \end{itemize}
